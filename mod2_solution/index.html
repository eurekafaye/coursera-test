        <p>A latte is a classic coffee that's constructed with the two pillar ingredients: espresso and steamed milk. The word “latte” comes from the Italian word “caffè e latte” (other variants are “caffeelatte” and “caffellatte”), which simply means “coffee & milk.”</p>

        <p>A cappuccino contains equal parts of espresso, steamed and milk froth. The coffee cup for a cappuccino is smaller than a latte cup. Cappuccino takes its name from the Capuchin friars: the color of the espresso mixed with frothed milk was similar to the color of the Capuchin robe.

        <p>A macchiato is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted" so the literal translation of caffè macchiato is "stained” or “marked coffee.”</p>
